Beardy Calculator 2020 was created for lizard lovers far and wide who wonder, "Just HOW many Bearded Dragons can I feasibly fit in my home?"

Beardy Calc 2020 works with only 2 inputs
1: The square footage of your living space
2: The estimated percentage of furniture in said space

The calculator then divides the furniture integer by 100 and multiplies that by your square footage to determine the square footage of your furniture

Then, it subtracts the furniture square footage from the home square footage to get the lizard square footage

The lizard square footage is then divided by 2sqft (average size of a bearded dragon tank) to reveal just how many lizards you can fit in your remaining floorspace!
